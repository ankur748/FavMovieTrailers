This project can be used to display all your favorite movie trailers in an html page

- We need three sets of information to display the trailers
1) Movie Name
2) Movie Banner to display on the page (Web URL)
3) Movie Trailer (Youtube URL like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mOIxyRTY5I)

This information should be pushed in movies.txt file with data comma seperated like
Movie Name, Movie Banner URL, Movie Youtube URL

We then should execute the main.py file by issuing the command
python main.py

It will then open up the movie trailer page in your default browser with all your movies listed which are defined in movies.txt. You can then click on a movie banner and it will play the trailer of the movie which you described as youtube URL in movies.txt
